<p>Welcome! While our primary aim is to pass this class with flying colors, we also take your privacy (and our grade) seriously. Here's everything you need to know about how we (mis)handle your data:</p>

<h2>1. What Data We Collect</h2>
<p>We collect the following information because, well, databases:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Basic Stuff:</strong> Name, email address, passwords, and (preferably) fake events.</li>
    <li><strong>Event Details:</strong>date, time, location, and event names.</li>
    <li><strong>Browser Data:</strong> Because everyone else does it, and we promise we won't sell it.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
<p>Your data will be used for these very legitimate purposes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Organizing events you may or may not care about.</li>
    <li>Displaying events on calenders.</li>
    <li>Debugging code when things inevitably break.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. How We (Don’t) Share Your Data</h2>
<p>We promise not to share your data unless:</p>
<ul>
    <li>We accidentally commit it to GitHub in a public repo (oops).</li>
    <li>Our professor asks for it because they found something “interesting” during the demo.</li>
    <li>A fellow group member trips over a SELECT * statement.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Your Rights</h2>
<p>You have rights, but we’re not lawyers, so let’s keep it simple:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Access:</strong> You can request a copy of your data. It’ll be formatted in Comic Sans to discourage you from asking again.</li>
    <li><strong>Correction:</strong> If there’s a typo, tough luck—we’re students, not proofreaders.</li>
    <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> Sure, but it’s a manual process, so please allow 7-10 business years.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Data Security</h2>
<p>We’ve implemented top-tier security measures, such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Passwords like "Password123" stored securely (probably).</li>
    <li>Praying to the Cybersecurity Gods that no one notices our open ports.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Cookies</h2>
<p>Yes, we use cookies. Not the web kind—the edible kind. Feel free to bring some for the group project demo. We prefer chocolate chip.</p>

<h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>If we ever figure out how to update this project again, we might revise the privacy policy. Check back every finals season for updates.</p>

<h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
<p>If you have questions or complaints about this privacy policy, please submit them via our state-of-the-art ticketing system, a.k.a. our group chat on Discord.</p>

<p>We’re committed to making this project functional—and maybe even compliant. Thanks for trusting us with your (questionable) data!</p>
